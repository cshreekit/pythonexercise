QUESTION: 11 Write a program which takes numbers as input from users and print count, maximum, minimum, sum
and average of numbers. Use list to store these numbers. If user enters anything other than a number (except when
user enters quit, quit the program and display the results) then catch the exception using try/except and warn the user
and then continue the program until the user enters quit.
For Ex:
Give a number: 3

Give a number: quit
Results:
Maximum = 5.0
Minimum = 3
Sum = 8.0
Average = 4.0

Expected Result: {1: ‘a’, 2: ‘b’, 3: ‘c’, 4: ‘d’, 5:’e’ , 6: ‘f’}

QUESTION: 13 Write a program to convert speed in km/hr to m/s. Use raw_input() to take input(speed in km/hr) from
